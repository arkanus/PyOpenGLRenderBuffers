# Python OpenGL RenderBuffer example

## About

This code is a standalone example of using multiple renderbuffers in Python.  In this case a Teapot is rendered 4 times to different viewports then a shader is applied, the output is then sent to a renderbuffer.

The renderbuffers are then rendered to screen aligned quads and another shader (optionally) applied to the whole screen.
